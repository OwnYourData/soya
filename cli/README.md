# soya-cli

[SOyA (**S**emantic **O**verla**y** **A**rchitecture)](https://www.ownyourdata.eu/en/soya/) provides a framework to manage layers of semantic description for a dataset enabling well-defined annotation, validation, transformation, and human-readable display & data capture.

soya-cli provides easy-to-use tools for interacting with SOyA overlays and stacks.

This project is a prototype, therefore under development. \
soya-cli may not behave as expected and should not be used in production! \
Also code does surely not satisfy most of best practices in coding :-)

## Installation
